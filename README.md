# **Exploring Recursion In C**
This repository provides a collection of C code examples demonstrating various recursion algorithms. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly. It's often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. Â  

## Key Concepts:
**Base Case**: The condition that terminates the recursion.  
**Recursive Case**: The part of the function that calls itself.  

## Key Points:
Recursion can lead to elegant and concise solutions, but it's important to be mindful of potential pitfalls like stack overflow.
Tail recursion can be optimized by compilers to avoid excessive stack usage.
Consider using iterative solutions for performance-critical applications or when recursion might lead to stack overflow.
